> ## **Session-based Recommendation Using SR-GNN**
- ***In this project we are building Session Based Recommendation system Using Graph Neural Network.***
- ***We have used real world E-comm data which available on Kaggle : Retail Rocket Dataset.***
- ***For Implementing Graph Neural Network we have utiliesd PyGeometric Package which build on top of Pytorch.***

- **On gross level Project flow as below:**

    *1. Constructing Session Graphs*

    *2. Learning Item Embeddings on Session Graphs*

    *3. Generating Session Embeddings*
    
    *4. Making Recommendation and Model Training*
